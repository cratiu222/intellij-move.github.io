# Rename refactoring

Intellij Move allows you to rename any symbol and automatically correct any references in your code. 

## Rename item

To invoke the refactoring, select the name of the item to rename 
and press <shortcut key="$RenameItem"/> (or select **Refactor | Rename...** from the menu):

## Rename module file

In Move, modules are usually stored in files of the same name. If that condition is met, 
and there's only one module in the file, you can rename file together with the module:

![Rename Module File](rename_module_file.gif)

You can also rename the module instead, file will be renamed too.
