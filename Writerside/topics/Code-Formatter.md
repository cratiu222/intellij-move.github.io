# Code Formatter

Intellij-Move provides automatic code formatter to help making sure your code is pretty 
and looks the same across the whole project.

## Add formatting check to CI

### Qodana

The easiest way to add formatting check to your CI pipeline is 
using Jetbrains [Qodana Cloud service](https://qodana.cloud/). It's free 
for open-source projects.



### Manual

If your project is not public, and you don't want to buy Qodana license, 
you'd need to setup your CI formatter check manually.
