# 1.36.0

This release is supported with a grant from [Aptos Foundation](https://aptosfoundation.org/). 
The plugin is renamed to **Move on Aptos** on Jetbrains Marketplace, with new Aptos-specific logos.

Sui support is also removed from this release on. Sui Move language has diverged from the original 
Move Compiler with their **Move 2024** version of the language, and it became very costly to support it in the same source code.   

## Features

* Implement some of the Aptos Compiler V2 features: 
  - receiver-style functions (special `self` parameter for the functions),
    ![Receiver Style Functions](self_method.gif) { border-effect="line" width="500" }
    
  - resource access modifiers (`reads`, `writes`, `pure`)

* Implement fetching package dependencies on project import, and [Build / Sync window](Opening-Loading-Aptos-Projects.md#project-loading) to follow the steps.

* Simplify working with Aptos CLIs from different OSes: download Aptos CLI from the IDE on Windows and Linux, add note on using Homebrew for MacOS.
  
* Implement running [External Linters](Code-Analysis.md#external-linters).

* Added `aptos move decompile` integration, see [the docs](Decompiling.md).

## Internal

* Drop 2023.2 platform.

* Add UI Selenium tests.
