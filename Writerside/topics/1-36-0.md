# 1.36.0

This release is supported with a grant from [Aptos Foundation](https://aptosfoundation.org/)!

## Features

* Implement some of the Aptos Compiler V2 features: 
  - receiver-style functions (special `self` parameter for the functions), 
  - resource access modifiers (`reads`, `writes`, `pure`)

* Implement fetching package dependencies on project import, and [Build / Sync window](Opening-Loading-Aptos-Projects.md#project-loading) to follow the steps.

* Simplify working with Aptos CLIs from different OSes: download Aptos CLI from the IDE on Windows and Linux, add note on using Homebrew for MacOS.
  
* Implement running [External Linters](Code-Analysis.md#external-linters).

* Added `aptos move decompile` integration, see [the docs](Decompiling.md).

## Fixes

## Internal

* Drop 2023.2 platform.
