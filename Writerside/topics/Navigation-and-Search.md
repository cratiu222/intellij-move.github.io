# Navigation and Search

You can quickly navigate through your Move code, as well as through the IDE elements, using various actions and popups.

## Go-to-Definition



## Find usages

The **Find Usages** action helps you search for the references of a code element across the codebase. 

<procedure title="Find usages in file" id="find_usages_in_file">
<step></step>
</procedure>

<procedure title="Search for usages in a project" id="search_for_usages_in_a_project">
<step>Select a symbol, then right-click it and choose <b>Find Usages</b> from the context menu, or press TODO.</step>
</procedure>

1. In the editor, place the caret at a symbol you want to find.

2. By default, the IDE automatically highlights all found usages in the file:

    TODO: screenshot

3. By pressing TODO-SHORTCUT, usages popup is invoked with the list of usages:

    TODO: gif

4. You can also use the <shortcut key="$DeclUsages"/> on the item definition to get the same list.

   TODO: gif

## File structure

You can explore the structure of the currently opened file in the **Structure** tool window or in a popup.

* To open the **Structure** tool window, select **View | Tool Windows | Structure** from the main menu or press TODO-SHORTCUT.

* To view the file structure in a popup, select **Navigate | File Structure** from the main menu or press TODO.
