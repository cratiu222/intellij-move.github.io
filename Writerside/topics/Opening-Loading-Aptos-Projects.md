## Project loading

When you open or update an existing Aptos project, the plugin takes project information from the **Move.toml** files 
and opens the **Build** tool window (the **Sync** tab) to show the progress and result of project loading. 
Click TODO-icon to view all the steps:

### Automatic reloading

TBD

### Manual reloading

If automatic reloading is partly/fully disabled, the IDE will still let you know whenever the model needs an update 
- the editor will display a button that you can use to quickly reload the model.

Alternatively, you can reload projects through the Cargo tool window (**View | Tool Windows | Cargo**) 
by clicking the TODO-reload-icon in the toolbar.
